# Privacy Policy for Personal Relationship Manager (PersonalRM / PersonalCRM)
Last Updated: 2/14/2026

Your personal relationships should remain exactly that: personal. This policy explains how we handle your data and our commitment to your privacy.

## 1. What Data We Collect
Because PersonalRM is a tool to help you manage your social circle, we collect information that you voluntarily provide, including:
 - Account Information: Your email address and name to create your account.
 - Relationship Data: Names, birthdays, contact details, and notes about your friends and family that you manually enter into the app.
 - Usage Data: Basic technical information (like device type or app version) to help us fix bugs and improve performance.

## 2. How We Use Your Data
We use your data strictly for app functionality. This includes:
 - Syncing your contacts across your devices.
 - Displaying your relationship history within the app.
 - Determining reccomended follow up priority.

What we NEVER do:
 - We do not sell your data to third parties.
 - We do not share your data with advertisers.
 - We do not "mine" your notes or relationship data for marketing insights.

## 3. Data Storage & Security
Your data is stored in a secure database managed by DigitalOcean. We use industry-standard encryption to protect your information during transit.

## 4. Third-Party Services
We only use third-party services that are essential to running the app:
 - Database/Hosting: To store your information so you don't lose it if you switch phones.
 - Authentication: To let you log in securely.

## 5. Your Rights and Control
You are in total control of your data. At any time, you can access your data or delete your data directly in the app. We do not store any information except for what is directly displayed in the app.

If you delete any data in the app it is permanently removed from our database, we cannot access it when it has been deleted.

## 6. Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy as we add new features. If we make significant changes, we will notify you via the app or email.
